The game I want to create is a clone of the game "Cookie Clicker" which is an incremental collecting game where you click the cookie to gain a cookie, and with those cookies you can buy upgrades to get more cookies per click and automatic clickers. Instead of cookies though, I want to use burgers instead! Here is a list of features I want in the game:

Shop system to buy upgrades
Upgrades (increase burger per click amount, chefs to make more burgers, etc)
Saving your game (burger count and upgrades)
