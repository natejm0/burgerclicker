The game I want to make for this project is a clone of cookie clicker, but with burgers instead. It would obviously include drawing graphics to the screen and interacting with them and changing values based on those interactions. But other things to implement would be upgrades. Stuff like Chef upgrades that could increase automation rates for burgers, Or better grills to make the burgers faster.
